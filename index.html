                  Hello, I'm a frontend-developer. I have been working with building websites for 7 years now. It all
                  started off
                  during my education as a media graphic designer (2011-2015, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nextkbh.dk/">KTS</a>).
                  I was taught some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, and at first I was pretty sceptical, but quickly
                  learned that
                  it was alot of fun! I passionately worked with it since, from projects on my own, projects at the
                  workplace to
                  helping others trying to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I really like the design and creative aspect of frontend. I actually started my education with the dream
                  of
                  becoming a
                  designer. I loved Photoshop and Illustrator at the time,
                  so when I was introduced to a program called Dreamweaver and coding, I was like ... what are these weird
                  codes on
                  my
                  screen?
                  I quickly learned more about it, and it turned out to be a nice combination of things. I could still
                  design, but
                  with
                  code instead of Photoshop. Time went by, and I got more and more into coding. There were so many things
                  to learn
                  and my need for being creative, was still satisfied all the way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coming up to now, I enjoy exploring new areas of frontend as much as possible. I started learning
                  TypeScript some
                  time ago, and I think it's great tool for developers to use.
                  I have been writing JavaScript for a long time (ES5), but never moved on to ES6. I was introduced to
                  TypeScript at
                  my current workplace and been loving it ever since!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have worked with some frameworks also like ReactJS, PreactJS and Angular (1 and 2). ReactJS is
                  definitely the
                  number 1 for me. It's a great toolbox for a team to use. There is alot of documentation and
                  a big community helping eachother.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>TL;DR:</b> I love coding websites and I also have a flair for design.
